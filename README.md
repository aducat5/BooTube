# BooTube
My youtube clone project in .NET C# MVC and in N-Tier architecture.

To implement project; 
1. Restore to an MSSQL Server the BooTube.bak database. It has all the sample data in it.
2. Find or set your MSSQL Server User and Password
3. Search for the Connection Strings in AppConfig in BooTube.BLL, AppConfig in BooTube.DAL and WebConfig in BooTube.PL.
4. Customize the Connection Strings for your server, username and password infos.
5. Build and Run.
